# SnapgramSE

#### This is the project done by Group-5 for the Sem-2 course "Software Engineering".

The project is a social media website build in ReactJS and backend is handled by AppWrite.

The project can be downloaded, installed, and run locally on your personal laptop following the below methods:

1. Download the project in zip file or clone the repository in your computer.
2. In the root folder, run the command `npm install` so as to install all dependencies for the computer locally.

After successfully install dependencies, you can run the code directly locally via the command `npm run dev` which will run a developement server on your local pc.

Although considered as a bad practice and we should never do so in real life projects, the environment variables file ".env" has also been uploaded on github in the repository so as to reduce your task of running the code and you can just run the project without dealing with dependencies much. You can also use your own AppWrite backend to connect to the frontend by making changes in the .env file and giving it values or your own backend api.

The project pdf has been uploaded in the root folder only.

The project has also been tested for any build faults and has been successfully deployed on the net via Vercel, so you can just go to the website and use it online without even installing the project locally.
